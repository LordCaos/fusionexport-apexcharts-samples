# FusionExport and ApexCharts Examples

This repository contains ready to use samples to export charts and dashboards built using [ApexCharts](http://apexcharts.com). To export these charts and dashboards, we use [FusionExport](http://fusioncharts.com/fusionexport) by [FusionCharts](http://fusioncharts.com)

Since this repository contains only examples, it is quite straight forward to get started once you have cloned the repository. Let's see how to run this examples for various langauges:

## Node.js

To run the Node.js examples, make sure that you arein the `node-js` directory. Once, done let's install all the Node.js dependencies before you run any examples:

```bash
cd node-js
npm install
```

Once everything is installed, simply pick an example and run it:

```bash
node examples/example-1/export-single-chart.js
```

## Python

Similar to Node.js, we can run Python examples as well. First, let's go to the `python` folder and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd python
pip install fusionexport
```

_Note: If you are an active user of `virutalenv` then directly create the environment on the `python` directory itself_

Once everything is installed, simply pick an example and run it:

```bash
python examples/example-1/export_single_chart.py
```

## Java

To run Java example, create a gradle project and install all the dependencies. Once dependencies are installed, run the `example_1.java` file as Java application
