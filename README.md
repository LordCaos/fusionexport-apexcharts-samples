# FusionExport and ApexCharts Examples

This repository contains ready to use samples to export charts and dashboards built using [ApexCharts](http://apexcharts.com). To export these charts and dashboards, we use [FusionExport](http://fusioncharts.com/fusionexport) by [FusionCharts](http://fusioncharts.com)

Since this repository contains only examples, it is quite straight forward to get started. First thing first, let's install all the Node.js dependencies after you have cloned into the repository:

```bash
npm install
```

Once everything is installed, simply pick an example and run it:

```bash
node examples/example-1/export-single-chart.js
```

That's it! If you need any help feel free to reach out to [support@fusioncharts.com](mailto:support@fusioncharts.com) or submit an issue. We are more than happy to help you.
